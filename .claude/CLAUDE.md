# Project Guidelines

## Code Quality Standards

- **Production-grade implementations only** - All code must be clean, streamlined, surgical, and production-ready
- **No solution hacks** - Hacky workarounds are not permitted or tolerated in this codebase
- **Professional standards** - Maintain professional rigor in all implementations

## Development Workflow

- **Always seek permission** before implementing new considerations or changes
- **Discuss first** - New considerations must be discussed before implementation
- **Type safety** - Always lookup type definitions; never assume property structures

**DO NOT RUN** the following commands in this project:
- `git` commands
